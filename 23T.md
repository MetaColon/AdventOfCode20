* Indices are needed
    * Next three _clockwise_ cups
    * Moving three cups _clockwise_ after destination
    * Selecting new current cup _clockwise_ after current cup
* Labels are needed
    * Destination cup with a _label_ equal to current cup's _label_ minus one
    * Not counting cups just picked up
    * _Label_ wrapping around
* Next index = current index + 3 in current array
* When overflowing, subarray until destination can be moved, instead of three cups
