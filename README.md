# AdventOfCode20
My solutions for Advent Of Code 2020

## How to use
Just compile using `gcc` or `clang` or something similar. There are no further dependencies, so

    gcc x.c && ./a.out
should run & output the xth solution.

Note that I sometimes have sacrificed the first solution for the second one.
